# TODO

## Preparation (Refactoring)

- [ ] implement `Board` as an immutable class (`set` returns a new `Board`)
- [ ] implement `Game` class, containing a `Board` and two `Player`s
- [ ] the AI function shall be moved into a `Player` instance and will be
  called with a reference to the `Game` instead of the `Board`
- [ ] refactor with `NumPy` arrays (instead of Python lists)

## Minimax

- [ ] implement Minimax strategy for one player
